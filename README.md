## 📌 Problem Statement

Insurance fraud in the auto sector is a pervasive issue, with fraudulent claims accounting for a significant portion of financial losses. These claims often involve exaggerated injuries, staged accidents, or falsified information, making them challenging to detect manually. The objective is to develop an AI-driven system that:

- **Automates fraud detection**: Identifies suspicious claims with high accuracy in real-time.
- **Prioritizes investigations**: Flags high-risk claims for further scrutiny, optimizing resource allocation.
- **Reduces false positives**: Minimizes incorrect fraud flags to maintain customer trust.
- **Enhances efficiency**: Streamlines the claims management pipeline, reducing processing time and costs.

The system uses historical claim data to train ML models, enabling insurers to proactively combat fraud and mitigate financial losses.

## ⚙️ Features of the Solution

The fraud detection system incorporates a comprehensive pipeline with the following features:

1. **Duplicate Detection & Removal**:
   - Identifies and removes duplicate `Claim_ID` entries to ensure data integrity.
   - Uses pandas’ `drop_duplicates()` for efficient processing.

2. **Missing Value Identification & Imputation**:
   - Detects missing values using `isnull()` and computes their percentage per feature.
   - Imputes missing values:
     - **Categorical**: Mode imputation (e.g., most frequent `Gender`).
     - **Numerical**: Mean or median imputation (e.g., `Annual_Mileage`).
     - **Temporal**: Forward fill for time-series data like `Accident_Date`.

3. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Applies **Z-Score** (e.g., values beyond ±3 standard deviations) and **Interquartile Range (IQR)** methods to identify outliers in financial and mileage-related features.
   - Options to cap, remove, or transform outliers based on domain knowledge.

4. **Feature Encoding & Scaling**:
   - Encodes categorical features:
     - **Label Encoding**: For ordinal features like `Accident_Severity`.
     - **One-Hot Encoding**: For nominal features like `Gender` or `Accident_Type`.
   - Scales numerical features using `StandardScaler` to normalize distributions for ML algorithms.

5. **Data Imbalance Handling**:
   - Uses **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to generate synthetic samples for the minority class (`Fraud_Ind = Y`), addressing class imbalance.
   - Ensures balanced training data to improve model performance on rare fraudulent cases.

6. **Model Training**:
   - Trains 10 ML classifiers to compare performance (see Algorithms Used section).
   - Employs cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold) to ensure robust model evaluation.

7. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Assesses models using:
     - **Accuracy**: Overall correctness.
     - **Precision**: Proportion of true fraud cases among flagged claims.
     - **Recall**: Proportion of actual fraud cases correctly identified.
     - **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
     - **ROC-AUC**: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for model discrimination.
   - Prioritizes **recall** to minimize missed fraudulent claims and **F1-score** for balanced performance.

8. **Model Comparison & Visualization**:
   - Generates a leaderboard comparing model performance across metrics.
   - Visualizes results using bar plots and ROC curves (via `matplotlib` and `seaborn`).

9. **Final Fraud Prediction**:

## 🧠 How It Works (Pipeline Overview)

The fraud detection pipeline is implemented in Python and follows these steps:

```python
# 1. Load dataset
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("data/auto_insurance.csv")

# 2. Drop duplicates
data = data.drop_duplicates(subset="Claim_ID")

# 3. Handle missing values
data["Annual_Mileage"].fillna(data["Annual_Mileage"].mean(), inplace=True)
data["Gender"].fillna(data["Gender"].mode()[0], inplace=True)

# 4. Encode categorical features
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
data["Accident_Severity"] = label_encoder.fit_transform(data["Accident_Severity"])
data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=["Gender", "Accident_Type"])

# 5. Outlier detection (Z-Score)
from scipy.stats import zscore
data = data[abs(zscore(data["Total_Claim"])) < 3]

# 6. Feature scaling
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
numerical_cols = ["Age_Insured", "Annual_Mileage", "Total_Claim"]
data[numerical_cols] = scaler.fit_transform(data[numerical_cols])

# 7. Train/Test Split
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X = data.drop("Fraud_Ind", axis=1)
y = data["Fraud_Ind"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 8. Handle class imbalance (SMOTE)
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_train_bal, y_train_bal = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

# 9. Train 10 classification models
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_bal, y_train_bal)

# 10. Evaluate and compare metrics
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")
print(f"Precision: {precision_score(y_test, y_pred, pos_label='Y')}")
print(f"Recall: {recall_score(y_test, y_pred, pos_label='Y')}")
print(f"F1-Score: {f1_score(y_test, y_pred, pos_label='Y')}")
print(f"ROC-AUC: {roc_auc_score(y_test, model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1])}")

# 11. Save best model
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, "models/saved_model.pkl")
```

- **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR or CCPA when handling sensitive customer data.

### 🚀 Scalability
- The pipeline is designed to handle large datasets efficiently using pandas and scikit-learn.
- For massive datasets, consider distributed computing frameworks like Dask or Spark.
- Deploy the model on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP) for real-time processing.

### 📉 Limitations
- **Data Quality**: The model’s performance depends on the quality and completeness of the dataset. Missing or noisy data may reduce accuracy.
- **Generalization**: The model may need retraining for different insurance markets or regions.
- **Evolving Fraud Patterns**: Fraudsters adapt over time, requiring regular model updates and monitoring.
